Pipeman
============
Puzzle game

###Welcome
This simple Ansi C game that uses pre-5.0 Allegro libraries. The Allegro GUI Clinic proved to be very useful reference during this project. The game is about rotating pipes so that water could flow through them to the right end.

###Controls
Backspace cancels game play and returns you to main menu. Esc exits game while in mine menu To rotate the pipes simply right click on them.

###Dead ends
The game was designed with some features in mind that where never implemented, so don't be surprised with menu items like 'Hall of Fame' :)

###Port to Allegro 5
As soon as I hear of GUI for OSX I plan to get to it.
