{"body":"### Welcome\r\nThis simple Ansi C game that uses pre-5.0 Allegro libraries. The Allegro GUI Clinic proved to be very useful reference during this project. The game is about rotating pipes so that water could flow through them to the right end.\r\n\r\n### Controls\r\nBackspace cancels game play and returns you to main menu.\r\nEsc exits game while in mine menu\r\nTo rotate the pipes simply right click on them.\r\n\r\n### Dead ends\r\nThe game was designed with some features in mind that where never implemented, so don't be surprised with menu items like 'Hall of Fame' :)\r\n\r\n### Port to Allegro 5\r\nAs soon as I hear of GUI for OSX I plan to get to it.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n[Windows binary](https://github.com/downloads/simon-joseph/Pipeman/pipeman.exe)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
